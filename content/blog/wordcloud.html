<h2>What is a Word Cloud?</h2>
<p>A word cloud is an image composed of words whose size is determined by the frequency in which they appear. Today, we will be creating a word cloud from the Tame Impala album, Currents. First, create a word text file, and save the lyrics (no titles) in that file. Save both this file and a new R script file in the same directory. Now we can begin.</p>
<p>Read in the text file with the <b>scan</b> function.Scanning the data shows that there are 407 lines. The character function returns the character value, while the new line <b> is used as a seperator. Store the in the variable,<i>lines</i>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lines&lt;-scan(&#39;currents album.txt&#39;,what=character(),sep=&#39;\n&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Run head(lines) to view the the first several rows of the matrix/data frame. You can also use tail(lines) to view the last rows.</p>
<p>Create a new data fram with that views each line of text. Earlier we saw that we had 407 lines. Set <i>line</i> equal to the ratio of the first to last line. Set text equal to <i>lines</i>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lines_df&lt;-data_frame(line=1:407,text=lines)</code></pre>
<p>Now, use unnest_tolkens() to create a new column, word, from text. Store this into the data frame, words_df</p>
<pre class="r"><code>words_df&lt;-lines_df%&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)</code></pre>
<p>Common words can clutter our word cloud. Filter these out with <b> %in% </b>. This compares the word column in words dataframe to the word column in the stop_words dataframe. Use the ! symbol to stop common words. Store back into words_df.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>words_df&lt;-words_df%&gt;%
  filter(!(word %in% stop_words$word))</code></pre>
<p>Next,group by the word column. Use summarise to count the number of times the the appears. Store as word_freq.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>word_freq&lt;-words_df%&gt;%
  group_by(word)%&gt;%
  summarise(count=n())</code></pre>
<p>We are now ready to finalize our wordcloud. View pallete colors with the <b>display.brewer.all()<b> function. We are going to select the word and count column in word_freq. Our color pallete today is called <b>Set2</b>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wordcloud(word_freq$word,word_freq$count,color=brewer.pal(24, &#39;Set2&#39;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in brewer.pal(24, &quot;Set2&quot;): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Set2 is 8
## Returning the palette you asked for with that many colors</code></pre>
