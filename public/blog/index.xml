      <description>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to plot data on a graph using the lahman baseball database.
Open a new R Script.The following will need to be installed: lahman,ggplot2,ggiraph, and dplyr.This can be achieved by choosing the Install Packages option under the Tools tab. Once installed, pull from the library as seen below:
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
FALSE FALSE Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;
FALSE The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;:
FALSE FALSE filter, lag
FALSE The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;:
FALSE FALSE intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)
Now we can begin.</description>

      <title>Data Visualization: Histograms and Bar Charts</title>

      <description>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create histograms and barcharts using dplyr and the lahman data base. Histograms are useful when a variable is represented by a range of numbers rather than a single point (such as in line charts). Simularly, a bar chart measures the height (numerical value) of a variable.
For example, if you survey a room of 100 people on their favorite color you may recieve the following random sample results: blue 45, red 12, purple 20, orange 13, yellow 8, and green 2.</description>

      <description>This is the second tutorial on creating historgrams via RStudio. Install the following and pull from the library:
library(dplyr)
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)
Extracting the Data
In the last post, we assigned our extracted data to df(dataframe).Complete this step again.
df&amp;lt;-Teams%&amp;gt;%
filter(yearID==1980)%&amp;gt;%
select(name,HR)%&amp;gt;%
arrange(HR)
str give the structure of whatever data you have. Store your data as a factor vector, rather than a character vector.The benefit to this is that factor vectors are organized into different levels .</description>
