      <description>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to plot data on a graph using the lahman baseball database.
Open a new R Script.The following will need to be installed: lahman,ggplot2,ggiraph, and dplyr.This can be achieved by choosing the Install Packages option under the Tools tab. Once installed, pull from the library as seen below:
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)FALSE FALSE Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;FALSE The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;:FALSE FALSE filter, lagFALSE The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;:FALSE FALSE intersect, setdiff, setequal, unionlibrary(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Now we can begin.</description>

      <title>Data Visualization: Histograms and Bar Charts</title>

      <description>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create histograms and barcharts using dplyr and the lahman data base. Histograms are useful when a variable is represented by a range of numbers rather than a single point (such as in line charts). Simularly, a bar chart measures the height (numerical value) of a variable.
For example, if you survey a room of 100 people on their favorite color you may recieve the following random sample results: blue 45, red 12, purple 20, orange 13, yellow 8, and green 2.</description>

      <description>What is Flexdashboard?Flexdashboard is an R package that allows the user to display data visualizations such as graphs,tables, tables, and widgets on a dashboard. Flexdashboard users can easily make size adjustments to chart proportions, and make the visualizations mobile friendly. An example of flexdashboard being used in this tutorial can be found below: https://kstaud85.github.io/https-kstaud85.github.io-dashboard/
Install and pull the following packages from the library:
library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)library(flexdashboard)library(stringr)library(lubridate)The data used today can be found on kaggle, but any data set is suitable: https://www.</description>

      <description>This is the second tutorial on creating historgrams via RStudio. Install the following and pull from the library:
library(dplyr)library(Lahman)library(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Extracting the DataIn the last post, we assigned our extracted data to df(dataframe).Complete this step again.
df&amp;lt;-Teams%&amp;gt;%filter(yearID==1980)%&amp;gt;%select(name,HR)%&amp;gt;%arrange(HR)str give the structure of whatever data you have. Store your data as a factor vector, rather than a character vector.The benefit to this is that factor vectors are organized into different levels .</description>

      <description>What is a Word Cloud?A word cloud is an image composed of words whose size is determined by the frequency in which they appear. Today, we will be creating a word cloud from the Tame Impala album, Currents. First, create a word text file, and save the lyrics (no titles) in that file. Save both this file and a new R script file in the same directory. Now we can begin.</description>
