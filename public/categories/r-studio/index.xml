      <description>This is a tutorial on how to create a time series plot in R Studio. We will be using the same data we used to create an instagram, and apply the same extracting techniques.
Install the following and pull from the library:
library(dplyr)library(Lahman)library(ggplot2)Extracting the DataAssigned the extracted data to result (dataframe).
result&amp;lt;-Batting%&amp;gt;%filter(playerID==&amp;#39;ruthba01&amp;#39;)%&amp;gt;%select(yearID,SO,HR)Data visualizationIn this representation, we are going to name our x and y coordinates with xlab and ylab, repsectively.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to plot data on a graph using the lahman baseball database.
Open a new R Script.The following will need to be installed: lahman,ggplot2,ggiraph, and dplyr.This can be achieved by choosing the Install Packages option under the Tools tab. Once installed, pull from the library as seen below:
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggplot2)library(ggiraph)Now we can begin.
Grouping &amp;amp; Filtering DataUnder the Insert tab choose R.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create barcharts using dplyr and the lahman data base. Bar charts are useful for showing the height (numerical value) of a variable.
For example, if you survey a room of 100 people on their favorite color you may recieve the following random sample results: blue 45, red 12, purple 20, orange 13, yellow 8, and green 2. A bar chart would list the colors on the X axis, with blue being the highest bar and green the lowest.</description>

      <description>This is the second tutorial on creating historgrams via RStudio. Install the following and pull from the library:
library(dplyr)library(Lahman)library(ggplot2)Extracting the DataAssigned the extracted data to result (dataframe).
result&amp;lt;-Batting%&amp;gt;%filter(playerID==&amp;#39;ruthba01&amp;#39;)%&amp;gt;%select(yearID,SO,HR)Data visualizationIn the last post, we used ggplot to create a visual representation of the data. In this representation, we are going to name our x and y coordinates with xlab and ylab, repsectively. Use ggiraph to change color characteristics when hovering over the graph.</description>
